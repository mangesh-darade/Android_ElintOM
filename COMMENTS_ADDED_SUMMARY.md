## Comment Style Used

All comments follow KDoc/JavaDoc style with:

### Class-Level Comments
```kotlin
/**
 * ClassName - Brief Description
 * 
 * Purpose: Detailed explanation of what this class does
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Feature 1
 * - Feature 2
 * 
 * Use Case: When and why to use this class
 * 
 * @param paramName Description of constructor parameters
 */
```

### Method-Level Comments
```kotlin
/**
 * Brief description of what the method does
 * 
 * Detailed explanation including:
 * - How it works
 * - Important algorithms or logic
 * - Side effects
 * 
 * @param paramName Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 * @throws ExceptionType When this exception is thrown
 */
```

### Inline Comments
- Explain complex logic
- Document ESC/POS commands with hex codes
- Clarify Android version-specific code
- Note important side effects

## Benefits of Added Comments

1. **Learning Resource**: New developers can understand the codebase quickly
2. **Maintenance**: Easier to modify and debug code
3. **Documentation**: Serves as inline documentation
4. **Best Practices**: Demonstrates proper Android development patterns
5. **ESC/POS Protocol**: Documents thermal printer command protocol

## Next Steps

To complete the commenting process:

1. Add comments to remaining printer files (USB, LAN, Receipt Formatter)
2. Comment document handling utilities
3. Add high-level architecture comments to MainActivity
4. Consider refactoring MainActivity into smaller components
5. Add comments to viewer activities

## Usage

All commented files maintain their original functionality. The comments are:
- Non-intrusive (don't affect code execution)
- Comprehensive (explain both "what" and "why")
- Professional (follow industry standards)
- Educational (help developers learn Android and ESC/POS)

## File Statistics

- **Total Kotlin Files**: 22
- **Fully Commented**: 7 (32%)
